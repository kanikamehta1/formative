                                       COMPUTER SCIENCE - lets sell it to you.

                                    How the heck do you define computer science? 

Well, Computer Science is basically a forever evolving concept which involves an individual in the make up of the world making it a super creative and challenging sector to get involved in. There'll always be something new and out of the blue happening in this department and this lifelong promise of learning and 'woah that's so f-ing cool!' moments is pretty appealing and enough to sell this engrossing subject. 

The sphere of communication is expanding on a daily basis thanks to computer science. This enormous world is condensed on the small 5.8 inch screeen [apple user friendly article] and everything is at our finger tips (alexa play me one call away by charlie puth). Oh and Alexa and Google, yep these are some awesome inventions too with the obvious help of C.S. We can now predict natural calamities such as tsunamis, earthquakes etc and save lives of millions with technology. Data science and AI (artifical intelligence) which are subsets of this subject are now helping us advance healthcare processes along with 3D printing which is that one 'woah that's so f-ing cool!' moment.

You can enter this department with nil knowledge about it and the subject will help you adapt to its concepts pretty smoothly that you'll be a tech genius in no time!

This article is brought to you by Kanika [kun-ika] who is struggling in max of all her 5 modules so send immediate help. This is not her last minute submission and she does'nt understand why this particular piece of info needs to be addressed in *bold* [italics because she still needs to figure out how to get that bold feature thing]. She had submitted her summative at sharp 1:59pm and whiled away the hours that followed in Flat White [a pretty awesome deal] followed by a binge of the Haunting of Hill House which was pretty clever considering this article's next day submission. Anyways, check out her fellow team mates' stuff as well, pretty dope kids. And by dope she mean some pretty intelligent and cool kids who probably have much better content.
